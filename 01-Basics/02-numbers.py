# Remember, this is a comment, it doesn't do anything!
# The first thing you should do is run this program, it should print a bunch of garbage

# Part 1: Basic functions
# Write the body of the following functions (I'll provide test cases, as usual)

print("Part 1:")

# Returns x minus 1
def sub_one(x):
    return 0
    
print(sub_one(6))   # Should print 5
print(sub_one(0))   # Should print -1
print() #spacing, ignore

# Prints the triple of x
def print_triple(x):
    print(0)
    
print_triple(3)     # Should print 9
print_triple(-9)    # Should print -27
print() #spacing, ignore

# Returns x + (1 if y is odd, 0 if y is even)
# Remember how % works!
def add_even(x, y):
    return 0
    
print(add_even(4, 6))   # Should print 4
print(add_even(3, 5))   # Should print 4
print() #spacing, ignore

# Part 2: Writing your own functions
# Write each of the following functions from scratch
# Uncomment (remove the '#' preceding) the tests once you've written the function to try it out!

print("Part 2:")

# Write a funcion called div_ten that divides a number by 10

# print(div_ten(10)) # Should print 1.0
# print(div_ten(14)) # Should print 1.4
# print()           # spacing, ignore


# Write a function called big_diff that subtracts the second two numbers from the first number

# print(big_diff(3, 5, 7))  # Should print -9
# print(big_diff(5, 1, -2)) # Should print 6
# print()                   # spacing, ignore

# Finally, write a function called bad_div
#  that adds the integer division (//) of two numbers to the remainder (%) of that division

# print(bad_div(6, 3))      # Should print 2
# print(bad_div(4, 3))      # Should print 2
# print(bad_div(7, 4))      # Should print 4
# print()                   # Spacing, ignore
