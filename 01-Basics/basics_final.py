# For the final assignment of this section, we're going to make something a bit more complicated
# The goal of this program is to build a program to simplify two (simple) polynomials multiplied together
# Specifically, we would like to simplify (ax + by)*(cx + dy), where a,b,c,d are inputs given by the user
# We want to print the result in terms of x^2, xy, and y^2 (all of which can be represented as strings)

# For example, for a = 2, b = 3, c = 2, d = 3
# We would print 4x^2+12xy+9y^2

# A helpful function for this assignment is str, which converts a number to a string

# I've sketched the outline of this program below
# However, feel free to modify this program however you want to make it work

# Given a left, middle, and right term
# Formats the string to output
def result_string(x2, xy, y2):
  return ""

# Calculates the x^2 term l
def calc_x2(a, b, c, d):
  return 0

# Calculates the xy term  
def calc_xy(a, b, c, d):
  return 0

# Calculates the y^2 term    
def calc_y2(a, b, c, d):
  return 0

# First, get the input from the user, storing it in 4 different variables
print("Give a value for a:")
print("Give a value for b:")
print("Give a value for c:")
print("Give a value for d:")

# Second, use those values to calculate x^2, xy, and y^2

# Finally, print the result
