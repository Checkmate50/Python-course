## Welcome

Welcome to this discussion!  For this course, we'll be looking at a variety of Python programing ideas as well as some basic principles of Algebra and Geometry.  The basic syllabus is as follows:

* Introductory programming with types and basic functions
* Conditionals (if-then-else statements)
* Arrays and Lists
* Loops (while and for loops)
* Dictionaries
* Advanced Functions
* Object basics
* Pygame basics
* And potentially more!

### Math

Some math concepts I intend to touch on:

* Exponents and Logarithms
* Systems of Equations
* Shapes: area calculations
* Trigonometric concepts
* And more!

## Assignments

I'll try and keepup with giving and grading assignments once a week on average.  I'll list deadlines per-student; let me know if you need an extension and it shouldn't be an issue to give it to you.  Late assignments will be accepted, though I can't grade an assignment until I get it!  I grade on a star system as follows:

* No stars  = F-B
* \*        = A-
* \*\*      = A
* \*\*\*    = A++
* \*\*\*\*  = Above and beyond!

The summary of this star system is that getting a star is very good, and two stars is excellent!  You have to do pretty much perfect to get three or higher stars, so don't expect to get that very much.  I only give 4 stars in exceptional circumstances.

All assignments are rated in terms of difficulty:

* \+  = Standard assignment
* ++  = Extra credit
* +++ = Extra challenging bonus assigment (!)

## Course Material

All course material will be posted online in the form of either written documents or recorded lectures.  Extra help will be given one-and-one, just bug me and I can find time to help you out.  I really enjoy teaching ideas in Python, so don't hesitate to ask if you have questions or if there's confusion.
