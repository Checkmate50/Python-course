# Python-course
An introductory course for Python programming, intended to be used by those looking to program with little-to-no prior experience.

## Welcome

Welcome to this discussion!  For this course, we'll be looking at a variety of Python programing ideas over the course of a series of lectures.  The basic syllabus is as follows:

* Introductory programming with types and basic functions
* Conditionals (if-then-else statements)
* Arrays and Lists
* Loops (while and for loops)
* Dictionaries
* Advanced Functions
* Files and Modules
* Object basics
* And more!

## Assignments

If you're interested in doing the assignments and having them graded, email assignments to checkmatepython@gmail.com (not my real email, obviously).  Questions should all be either asked there or DM'd to me in discord (I'm Checkmate#0888).  Assignments can also be DM'd to me, though this is not preferred.

I'll try and keep up with grading assignments once a week on average.  I'll list deadlines per-student; let me know if you need an extension and it shouldn't be an issue to give it to you.  Late assignments will be accepted, though I can't grade an assignment until I get it!  I grade on a star system as follows:

* No stars = F-C
* \*      = A
* \*\*    = A++
* \*\*\*  = Above and beyond!

The summary of this star system is that getting a star is very good, and two stars is excellent!  You have to do pretty much perfect to get three or higher stars, so don't expect to get that very much / only on projects.

All assignments are rated in terms of importance:

* \+  = Standard assignment
* ++  = Extra credit
* +++ = Extra challenging bonus assigment (!)

## Course Material

All course material will be posted online in the form of either written documents or recorded lectures (potentially).  Extra help will be given one-and-one, just bug me and I can find time to help you out.  I really enjoy teaching ideas in Python, so don't hesitate to ask if you have questions or if there's confusion.
